        <div class = "history">What is Teriyaki Chicken?</div>
        <p>
            Teriyaki chicken is simply chicken that is coated in teriyaki sauce.
            The dish comes from the Japanese cooking technique called teriyaki,
            where meat is grilled or broiled with a soy sauce, mirin, and sugar glaze. 
            Today, teriyaki chicken refers to any chicken with teriyaki sauce; regardless
            of the cooking method.
        </p>
        <div class = "history">What is Teriyaki Sauce?</div>
        <p> 
            Traditional teriyaki sauce is made up of four ingredients: soy sauce, mirin, ginger, and sugar. But many chefs have their own takes on teriyaki sauce. 
            In this recipe, the teriyaki sauce includes soy sauce, sugar, ginger, cornstarch (for thickening), cider vinegar (instead of mirin), water, garlic, and black pepper.
        </p>
        <div class = "ingredients">Ingredients</div>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>¼ cup cider vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cold water</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            </ul>
            <div class = "prep-directions">Prepping</div>
            <h3><em>First:</em> Make the Teriyaki Sauce</h3>
            <p>In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, ground ginger, white sugar, minced garlic, cornstarch, cold water, cider vinegar, and black pepper. Simmer until thick and bubbling.</p>
            <h3><em>Second: </em>Glaze the Chicken</h3>
            <p>Coat the chicken on both sides with the teriyaki sauce. For more flavor, marinate the chicken in the sauce for a few hours or overnight.</p>
            <h3><em>Third: </em>Bake the chicken in a 425 degree F oven for 50 minutes, brushing with sauce every 10 minutes.</h3>
            <h3><em>Additional note about cook time</h3></em>
            <p>The <em>baking time can vary depending on how big your chicken pieces are.</em> In this recipe, the chicken is cooked for <strong>50-60 minutes.</strong> This should work for most chicken thighs.
                When in doubt, pull out your digital thermometer. <em>Teriyaki chicken is done when the chicken reaches an internal temperature of <strong>165 degrees F.</strong></em>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combine <em>sugar, soy sauce, cider vinegar, cornstarch, cold water, garlic, ginger, and pepper</strong></em> in a small saucepan over <em>low heat.</em> Simmer, <em>stirring frequently,</em> until teriyaki sauce thickens and bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
                    <li>Place chicken thighs in the prepared baking dish. <em>Brush both sides of each thigh</em> with the sauce. Reserve any extra sauce for basting.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li></strong></em>
                    <li><strong><em>Flip</strong> chicken and brush with sauce.</em> Continue to bake, basting with remaining sauce every 10 minutes, <em>until no longer pink and juices run clear, <strong>20 to 30 more minutes.</strong></li></em>
                </ol>
