        <p>
            <em>Lemon garlic chicken</em> is a popular dish that combines tender chicken with a flavorful sauce 
            made from lemon and garlic. The chicken is usually sautéed or roasted and then served with 
            a sauce that is made from <em>fresh lemon juice, minced garlic, olive oil, and herbs such as parsley 
            and basil.</em> The sauce is often used to baste the chicken as it cooks, infusing it with the bright 
            and tangy flavors of lemon and garlic. The finished dish is <em>typically served with sides such as</em> <strong>rice, 
            roasted vegetables, or a fresh salad,</strong> and is a great option for a weeknight dinner or a casual dinner party. 
            The lemon garlic flavor profile is bright, fresh, and savory, making it a popular choice for many home cooks 
            and diners alike.
